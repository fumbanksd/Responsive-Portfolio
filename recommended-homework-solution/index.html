      <p>My name is Dominic Fumbanks. I was born and raised in Milwaukee Wisconsin. Moving to Charlotte was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. Attending college for computer coding was always a dream of mine. I love the way technology works. Writing a code that works and does what you want it to is one of the most satisfying things ever.</p>

      <p>I love all sports. Im athletic and driven for success in any sport I compete in. I have played for 3 different colleges in my 5 years of college. I love to be competitive. If you ask any of my friends they will tell you how much I hate to lose. I'll continue to play you all day if that's what it will take for me to succeed.</p>
